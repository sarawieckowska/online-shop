    <h1>2. About Shopper</h1>
      <p>
        Shopper is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats
        and locations. The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer.
        Shopper is not a traditional auctioneer.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we may provide pricing, shipping, listing, sourcing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is
        solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of
        disputes through various programs, Shopper has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety
        or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to
        sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete
        a transaction or return an item.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>3. Using Shopper</h1>

          <li>fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in a Shopper policy,

            property rights (collectively, "Intellectual Property Rights") that belong to or are licensed to Shopper.
            Some, but not all, actions that may constitute infringement are reproducing, performing, displaying,
            distributing, copying, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or preparing derivative works
            from content that belongs to Shopper or someone else;</li>

          <li>circumvent any technical measures we use to provide the Services.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Sellers must meet Shopper's minimum performance standards. Failure to meet these standards may result in Shopper
        charging you additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we believe you are abusing Shopper and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without
        limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay
        or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display,
        and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent
        you from using our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we believe you are violating the policy on Offers to buy or sell outside of Shopper, you may be subject to a
        range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account
        features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and
        enforcement. If you are a seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their
        contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of Shopper, you may be liable to pay a final value
        fee applicable to that item, even if the item does not sell.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time or modify or
        discontinue our Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate all or part of our
        Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>4. Policy Enforcement</h1>
      <p>
        When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific
        circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort
        to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>5. Fees</h1>
      <p>
        The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Standard selling fees page. We may change our
        seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Shopper site 14 days in advance, but with no advance
        notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all
        Shopper Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of Shopper. In particular, if you
        offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of
        buying or selling outside of Shopper, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if
        the item doesn't sell, given your usage of Shopper Services for the introduction to a buyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must have a payment method on file when selling through Shopper Services and pay all fees and applicable
        taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is
        past due, we may collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection
        agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 60 days past due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed
        from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. Shopper, or the collection
        agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result,
        late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
        If you wish to dispute the information Shopper reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion)
        please contact us at Shopper Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729.
        If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your Shopper
        account, you must contact the collection agency directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on Shopper, whether on a web page, mobile app,
        or otherwise. We may, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other
        credit to, sellers, display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other
        content in any part of our Services.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>6. Listing Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        When listing an item, you agree to comply with Shopper's Listing policies and Selling practices policy and that:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered</li>
          <li>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24
            hours in some circumstances). Shopper can't guarantee exact listing durations</li>
          <li>When you use the consumer seller listing tool to create listings, your fixed-price listings may renew
            automatically every 30 days, based on the listing terms at that time, until the quantities sell out or
            until you cancel the listing</li>
          <li>Content that violates any of Shopper's policies may be modified, obfuscated or deleted at
            Shopper's discretion</li>
          <li>We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct information</li>
          <li>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance
            or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but
            not limited to: buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history, item's location,
            listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service</li>
          <li>To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results
            regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer</li>
          <li>Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain Services</li>
          <li>Shopper's Duplicate listings Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results</li>
          <li>Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect
            third-party search engine results</li>
          <li>We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings.
            Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and
            current listings; results will vary for individual listings. To drive the recommendations experience,
            you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to those
            of other sellers</li>
        </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>7. Purchase Conditions</h1>
    <p>
      When buying an item, you agree to the Rules and policies for buyers and that:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy</li>
        <li>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item,
          your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted)</li>
        <li>For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a
          buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract
          between the buyer and the seller</li>
        <li>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer</li>
        <li>Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of
          ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise</li>
      </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h1>8. International Buying and Selling</h1>
      <p>
        Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers. We may offer certain programs, tools,
        and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local
        currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for
        complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.
        If you purchase an item on an Shopper site other than shopper.com, you are subject to the User Agreement of that
        other Shopper site with respect to that particular purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may list your items directly on one or more of Shopper's international sites. Additionally, you may direct us
        to display your listing on Shopper sites other than the original Shopper listing site, including where you choose to
        list an item with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping or the Global Shipping Program);
        the appearance of your listings on these sites is not guaranteed. When you sell your items internationally, you
        agree to be subject to that other site's User Agreement, policies, and our Shopper Money Back Guarantee. You may
        adjust your account settings within My Shopper to indicate your preferences on international shipping by excluding
        international shipping and applying an exclusion list to the applicable countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your Shopper content and member-to-member communications,
        in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you
        with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any
        translation are not guaranteed.

    <h1>11. Holds</h1>
      <p>
        To protect Shopper from risk of liability for your actions as a seller, Shopper has at times recommended, and may
        continue to recommend, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain
        factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing
        category, transaction value, or the filing of an Shopper Money Back Guarantee case. This may result in PayPal
        restricting funds in your PayPal account.

    <h1>12. Authorization to Contact You; Recording Calls; Analyzing Message Content</h1>
      <p>
        Shopper may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, at any telephone number that you
        have provided us, to: (i) notify you regarding your account; (ii) troubleshoot problems with your account;
        (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires; or

        calls and text messages for marketing purposes (e.g., offers and promotions), if you consent to such
        communications. Our collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information is
        governed by the User Privacy Notice. As described in our User Privacy Notice, Shopper may collect other telephone
        numbers for you and may place manual non-marketing calls to any of those numbers and autodialed non-marketing
        calls to any landline. Standard telephone minute and text charges may apply and may include overage fees if you
        have exceeded your plan limits. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may change your
        communications preference at any time, including through the communication preferences section of your My Shopper.

    <h1>13. Additional Terms</h1>
      <h2>Returns and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances.
          For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, Shopper will set a default rule that automates
          the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within
          My Shopper. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an
          Shopper-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our returns
          policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize Shopper to request that PayPal remove
          the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice,
          and/or charge your payment method on file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller's responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          You (as seller) authorize Shopper to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice, subject to your
          automatic payment method on file when:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A Shopper-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;</li>
            <li>Returns have been automated;</li>
            <li>You fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an Shopper-generated
              shipping label is used; and/or</li>
            <li>A transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize Shopper to request that
              PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account.
              See canceling a transaction for more details.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Global Shipping Program</h2>
        <p>
          One of the ways that we may make shopper.com listings available to international buyers on shopper.com and on
          Shopper's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United
          States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will
          simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification
          of payment from your buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the
          processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer.
          To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, Shopper may respond directly
          to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or
          international shipping). You pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade
          Regulations, your buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for
          the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for
          the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests
          for additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order
          information, by Shopper to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers,
          and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies),
          in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any
          item. Shopper does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service
          providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost,
          damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items
          that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program and Global Shipping FAQs pages.

      <h2>Shopper Money Back Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          Most Shopper sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the Shopper Money Back Guarantee helps
          buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make
          a final decision on any Shopper Money Back Guarantee case.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or Shopper under the
          Shopper Money Back Guarantee, you authorize Shopper to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in
          same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your
          payment method on file. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using
          other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend the Shopper Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or
          interference with the proper working of the policy.
