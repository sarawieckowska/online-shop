    <h2>Orders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Where is my order?</span>
          <p>Your order will arrive within 3-5 days after it's been placed.You can find a personalised delivery estimate
            in the shipping confirmation email sent to your email address. So if you're wondering where your order is,
            please allow up to this date for your order to arrive. A tracking link is provided in your shipping
            confirmation email and becomes active within 24 hours. You can also track your order in the 'My Orders'
            section of your account, once the order has been shipped.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Can I modify my order after it has been placed?</span>
          <p>Unfortunately, we can’t make changes to your order after it's been finalised. Once an order is placed, the
            delivery option, delivery address, payment method, and product sizes can't be changed. But you can cancel an
            order for a limited time after it's been placed; before it’s picked in the warehouse. If this option shows as
            available to you, we recommend simply cancelling the order and placing a new one.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">How do I cancel my order?</span>
          <p>If you made a mistake or simply changed your mind after placing an order, there's no need to fuss.
            As long as your parcel has yet to be picked and packed in our warehouse, you'll have the option to cancel.
            To cancel your order:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to My Orders in your account</li>

              <li>Click on view/cancel order*</li>

              <li>Click on 'Cancel order' or 'Cancel items' and follow the steps on screen</li>
            </ol>
          <br>
          <p class="bold">
            Some important points:
          </p>
          <p>
            If you redeemed a voucher with your order, the order can only be cancelled in full. Your delivery
            address can't be changed once you have placed an order, but you can cancel the order and place a new one
            specifying a different address. Individual Shopper Partner items can't be cancelled. You can only cancel the
            Partner order in full.
          </p>
          <p>
            *If the 'cancel order' option is no longer available, it means your order has been processed in our warehouse
            and it's unfortunately too late to cancel it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">What if an item is out of stock?</span>
          <p>If an item you want is out of stock in your size, you can register to be notified when your size
            is available again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside your desired size in the size selection of the item page, just click on 'Notify me'. A pop up will
            appear where you can enter and submit an email address where the notification will be sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the size is restocked within the next 3 months, we'll send you an automatic email to let you know.
            This email does not reserve the item, so if you're still interested then its best to act quickly in
            case it sells out again.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Different orders delivered in one parcel</span>
          <p>
            In some cases we deliver items from several orders in the same parcel – we will let you know in advance in
            the delivery confirmation email. You can check whether your parcel contains items from more than one order by
            logging into your account where you can see which items belong to which order.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need to return items from different orders, you can pack them all in one return parcel.
          </p>
          <p>
            We bundle your orders to deliver your items in the quickest, most eco-friendly way possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">How can I place an order?</span>
          <p>To place an order, just follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Place an item in your bag: Pick the size you want and select 'Add to bag'. Go to your bag in the top
              right corner when you have finished shopping.</li>

            <li>Select your preferred delivery option. If you have chosen home delivery then confirm your address, if not
              then select your preferred parcel shop for delivery.</li>
            <li>You will be asked to select a payment method. Simply select the payment method you would like, fill in
              the details where required, and click next.</li>
            <li>You are now given the chance to check your order and add voucher codes or Express Delivery. If you are
              paying by PayPal you will now be redirected to the PayPal website to complete the process.</li>
            <li>Once your order has been completed you will see the confirmation on the screen. You will also receive a
              confirmation email with an order number as a reference and a link to a tracking number once the order is
              shipped, so that you can track the delivery of your parcel.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">How can I make sure my delivery address is correct?</span>
          <p>
            Before completing your order, please make sure that you have entered the correct delivery address.
            This is displayed on the right side of the screen during the checkout process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you notice you need to change this, just click on 'edit' before completing your order.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">How do I search for a specific item?</span>
          <p>

            click 'Search' button.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>

        <li><span class="bold">Can I return multiple orders at the same time?</span>
          <p>
            If you have items from several orders to return to us, simply fill out the return slip for each order,
            pack each item you are returning along with their return slip in one box, and use a return label from any of
            the orders (you only need one).
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind, this return process might take a little longer as all items have to be booked and delivered

            If an item is damaged or defective, you can file a complaint with us. To process this, we would need:
          </p>
            <ul class="smallFont">
              <li>A brief description about how the damage/defect has arisen.</li>

            </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            The defect must be clearly visible on at least one of the images. In addition, we would need complete photos
            of the product e.g. one from the front and one from the back. If the item is a shoe, we also
            require a picture of the sole.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can send the pictures via email to reclamation@Shopper.com. We kindly recommend you to use either ZIP,
            RAR or JPEG format when sending your pictures. Once we receive the photos, we will review your request as
            quickly as possible. You will receive feedback from us within a few days on how to proceed.

            3DS Authentication

          <p>
            Our checkout process uses 3DS authentication (Verified by Visa, MasterCard SecureCode and American Express
            SafeKey). These services enhance your existing card account against unauthorised use when you shop with us.
            If you require more detailed information or encounter a problem with the authentication process, please
            contact your card issuer directly. Unfortunately we have no control over the payment authentication process
            so we will be unable to assist with any authentication enquiries.

        <li><span class="bold">Paying with PayPal</span>
          <p class="bold">
            When will I be charged?
          </p>
          <p>
            PayPal payments are usually credited within a few minutes.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            What sort of payment confirmation will I receive?
          </p>
          <p>
            You will receive an order confirmation which contains the link to your PayPal payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If for some reason, the payment process is interrupted, this link offers you the chance to reprocess your
            payment with PayPal. Please note, however, that after three hours payment via PayPal is no longer possible.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            Can I pay by PayPal without creating a PayPal account?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, in order to do so select PayPal as your preferred payment method during checkout. At the end of the
            ordering process, you will be directed to PayPal. If you prefer not to create an account, then simply
            select the option ‘Don’t have a PayPal account?’ and you can enter your card details and confirm
            the payment as a PayPal guest.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            What happens if I make a return?
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount will be credited to your PayPal account, unless you have paid as a guest. In that case, the
            amount will be credited to your bank account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Paying with Prepayment</span>
          <p>
            Prepayment is not always shown as an available payment option and will only be offered as an alternative if
            no other payment method is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            If prepayment is the only offered payment method then we can not influence this. It doesn't mean that you
            won't get other payment options in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            How do I pay by prepayment?
          </p>
          <p>
            After placing the order, you'll receive a confirmation email with the necessary details for the bank transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as your payment reaches us, we will start processing your order. Depending on your bank, it may
            take 2-4 working days until your payment reaches us. The products you have ordered will be reserved for
            you for a maximum of 7 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be advised that, in order for us to process the order correctly, it is important that you enter the
            order number in the reference field and that you pay for each order separately.

          <p class="bold">
            How can I use Apple Pay?
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple Pay makes paying even easier, more secure, and more private than ever before. To start with,
            make sure you have the latest version of the Shopper app and have registered your card details in the
            Apple Wallet. You can then make a purchase with a single touch by placing your finger on Touch ID
            when checking out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later.
            You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra, and
            confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later, Apple Watch, or with a MacBook Pro featuring Touch ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is currently not possible to choose express delivery when paying with Apple Pay. In the event that you
            would like to send your items to a collection point, please input the address in the payment sheet
            directly and it will be automatically saved for next time.
          </p>
          <p class="bold">
            Is Apple Pay Secure?
          </p>
          <p>
            Security and privacy are at the core of Apple Pay. When you add a credit or debit card to Apple Pay,
            the actual card number is neither stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique number is
            assigned, encrypted, and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised
            with a one-time unique dynamic security code, instead of using the security code from the back of your card.

          <p>
            Please take your invoice to customs for a stamp within three months of receiving the goods. You will need
            to show the goods purchased at the time of receiving the stamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get in touch with our friendly Customer Care team to advise them that you have the stamped invoice.
            If they need a copy they will let you know how to send it over. Once the VAT refund has been issued we
            will notify you by email.
